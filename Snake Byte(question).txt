		x = xx + xx - 12090
		     and 
		x = xy + xy - 6554  (58,57)
	(*HINT: The Number x between 1- 100)

(They can't partcipate in Wildcard Round)

# Level 3
	--Write a program to show value
		 
		x^(8) + x^(7) + x^(6) + x^(5) + x^(4) + x^(3) + x^(2)
			formula to use : nx^(n-1)
		          To show this result:
		8x^(7) + 7x^(6) + 6x^(5) + 5x^(4) + 4x^(3) + 3x^(2) + 2x^(1)
		2 loops, 2 list, 14 variables, 2 print and all operators are allowed
	   (The students are allowed to directly Eliminated to participate in WildCard)  
#WildCard Round (Only for Level 2)
				(20 sec are added in timer)
	-- Write a program to remove odd numbers from list with based on condition:
		*one list or Array
		*one loop(number should not more than 8 and increment value has to be 1)
		*two variable(list or Array and variable used in loop)
		*deleteing the number by using (del) keyword or any keyword available in your program   

	(for php & JS)

 	--Write a script that can take the input from the user by using form with input tag (or) prompt which has to print the value in page with 
		 
# Level 4
	-- Write a program to count how many numbers are repeated twice in the list of 10 values 
           the values shoul'nt assigned in source code.
			inputs may [0,10,6,10,10,20,30,40,50,60]
	--(For javascript) Make a slideshow using given photo with buttons can pause, run and show desired photo. 
	--(For php) make a website to take input from the HOE that will be given later. then can caluculate the total amount to be paid by the loan-borrower. For male it has 
	to be 8% interest and for female it has to be 5% interest with amount of 2,00,000 for both. it will be paid after one year and if age crosses 40 yrs add 0.8% of interest
	for both Male and Female.('The Apache service has to stopped. If it is not stopped the students will directly eliminated')
